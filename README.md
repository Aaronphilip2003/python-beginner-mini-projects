# Python Mini Projects For Beginners

I recently started doing the #100DaysOfCode Challenge in Python. I've used Python before, but I had switched to JS related web-dev for a few months, so I wanted to start from scratch. So, I decided to create a repository to add a few small projects I'm doing as a part of the course and probably will add some more projects later.
