# Contributing to this Repository

- While making a contribution, please ensure that you clearly specify the changes you're making to this repository. Please do not modify or delete the existing projects.
- Feel free to make your own new projects and adding them here.

## Why this repository?

The idea is simple, it is to have people who are very new to Python get a good idea of what the language is capable of, try and explore its different aspects and enjoy the process of project-based learning with Python. 

## How to Contribute?

1. Create a new folder with the title of your project. 
2. Add your Python code in that folder (single or multiple files).
3. Make a pull request. 

## Please take note

- The project has to be simple, I'm not expecting a script that'll break the NASA data centers. 
- Try to use simple language, I know *Python enthusiasts* (myself included) fancy their opportunities to get everything done in one line, but this repository is meant to be beginner friendly.
- Please use comments wherever possible. If you think even a small bit of code requires explanation, please add comments. Think like you're just starting out with Python and have absolutely no idea how things work.
- Please refrain from dropping your credentials and API keys. Make use of `config` files, specify with comments that one would require an API key or a Secret key from a certain service. 

Happy contributing!
